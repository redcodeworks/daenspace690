After planning a traverse, the crew works together to gather as many of the desired rocks as possible within the time constraints:
1) develop an efficient route plan based upon the Execution Note
2) drive lunar rover (via telepresence) to each desired location adjusting route as needed
3) photograph and robotically capture (future capability) desired rock sample
4) complete the route at the end point (Tower representing the Lunar Ascent Vehicle, LAV). The rock samples are deposited in a Sample Return Canister (SRC). The LAV launches from the lunar surface and delivers the SRC to the Gateway in a Sample Return Vehicle (SRV).",HAL_5_101.pdf,10,Waiting (Where),in front of transfer port door
